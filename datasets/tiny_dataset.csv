Alan Gregerman discusses the meaning of human interactions and the kinds of situations that tend to inspire original and/or clear thinking that leads to innovation. These things include how people communicate in certain situations such as when they are outside of their normal patterns.

Gregerman identifies the ingredients that make innovation more likely. This includes people being compelled to interact when they normally wouldn't, leading to serendipity. Sometimes the phenomenon will occur through collaboration, and sometimes by chance such as when an individual is away from home on travel.

I recommend this book for its common sense, its truth and the apparent mastery of the subject by the author.",Clear on what leads to innovation,0,2.0,32,17,13,6,18,3,1,1,0,0,2,1,133,6

He opened my eyes to seeing the world in a fresh way and also taught me structured techniques that I can use to increase the creative problem solving skills of teams and individuals.

Alan untangles the difference between invention and innovation and makes it much easier to see that 99%+ of innovation is adaption of proven inventions borrowed from other industries, disciplines, contexts, and cultures.

His previous book, Surrounded by Geniuses, is excellent.  It is a great mix of ideas and memorable examples of his insights in action.

His newest book, The Necessity of Strangers, builds on that previous body of knowledge and delves further into a critical dimension of his innovation research about the power of making connections outside of one's group to discover alternative approaches to addressing a challenge.  The book is full of excellent examples of individuals and organizations tackling challenges by seeking ideas and insights from ""strangers"".  Alan borrows heavily from personal experience which enriches the storytelling aspect that makes his writing so accessible.

If you have not seen Alan teaching his ideas or present to an audience, I would highly recommend it.  He has been a featured speaker at a solution architect leadership development program at our firm.  He recently presented the ideas from The Necessity of Strangers to a large audience of executives at our firm that left people talking, engaged, and energized.

5,1,False,"09 7, 2013",1118461304,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},"As I began to read this book, I was again reminded of how deceptively complicated the word ""stranger"" is. It could refer to someone we have never heard of, of course, but it could also refer to someone we have met or heard about. We know their name but nothing else about them. Then there is another type of ""stranger"": someone we think we know well but really don't. We have false assumptions, a mindset, about who they are and aren't, what they can and can't do, and whether or not they would be willing to provide or receive assistance.

Alan Gregerman wrote this book to explain how and why - with all due respect to the importance of one's family members, friends, and associates -- it is imperative to engage, learn from, and collaborate with strangers. ""People who are very different from us are essential to our growth and success as individuals and organizations."" Just as Henry Chesbrough has devised an open business model, it could be said that Gregerman offers an open people model. How so?

""Each day we pass by more than one hundred people that could change our lives but we never make the time or effort to connect. The best way to solve any challenge or create any new opportunity is to begin by being curious about the world around us and realize that it is filled with remarkable people, insights, and possibilities."" Nonetheless, there are those false assumptions and, perhaps, at least some concern about being rejected and feeling embarrassed or even foolish.

He suggests a new paradigm individuals and organizations ""wise enough"" to incorporate exploration and openness in their DNA. Here's its formula:

Business and Personal Success =
What I Already Know +
My Knowledge or Understanding Gap +
A Stranger (or Strangers) Who Can Fill It

His citation of one of my favorite Charles Kettering quotations is dead-on:

""Where there is an open mind there will always be a frontier.""

Gregerman devotes a great deal of attention to explaining how to develop the necessary mindset, one that embraces rather than recoils from exploration and openness. There are four core principles that provide its foundation: humility, curiosity, respect, and purpose. For those who are especially reluctant to become explorers of what is -- for them -- not only unfamiliar but perhaps terrifying territory, I presume to suggest one other: the courage to which Jack Dempsey refers when explaining that ""champions get up when they can't.""

When concluding his book, Alan Gregerman acknowledges the difficulty while stressing the importance of ""taking the first step"" toward understanding the potential importance of strangers to us and (yes) our potential importance to them. He observes, ""As humans we have the amazing ability to be open and to dream, imagine, explore, learn, connect, share, collaborate, innovate, and grow, to go big instead of going home. So get out there and find the stranger or the [strange] idea that could change your life."" Who knows? We may be that stranger or have that idea that someone else needs.

Alan encourages us to get out of the comfort zone.

Alan argues that we need to get out of the office, walk around and see what other great companies are doing.

Why?  In his latest offering, Alan reminds us the importance of strangers in our lives and the companies and organizations where we work.  In this Facebook world we live in, where many of us may have thousands of friends, Alan reminds us that friends can only get us so far..they are often reflections of ourselves.

In clear and affable fashion, Gregerman guides his readers in an almost Socratic manner to embrace the insights and wisdom that are available to us once we look beyond the known.

Oddly -- or fortuitously -- enough, you and I are engaging in one of the practices he suggests in his book. One of the hallmarks of Amazon is its growing library of peer reviews and images. We don't know each other, and yet you paused in your consideration of this book to find out what earlier readers thought about it. And this is not a one-way street; there's every chance that you may use the ""comment"" function to add a question or other thought that would transform this from one person's observations and reflections into a conversation.

Gregerman begins with context, reviewing reasons for the common mistrust of strangers before illustrating how small even the largest personal network is likely to be. The nod to Socratic method begins with him asking readers to think about effective ways of gathering information, improving product, and thoroughly understanding our underlying mindset -- why we think the way we do, and how we can stretch ourselves beyond the status quo.

After exploring context, which he calls framework, Gregerman asks readers to consider how to translate interacting with strangers from abstract to concrete: using these new relationships to spur innovation, collaboration, leadership, and customers, both existing and new (yet more ""strangers""). Before setting us loose on a newly inviting world, Gregerman provides a succinct toolkit of strategies and techniques that we can begin using in everyday situations, as well as ways to spur our thinking and reflection.

He makes many thought-provoking points, and I believe they are best read in sequence. In fact, if you have an e-reader, you may want to buy the digital version so that you can highlight and annotate particularly salient thoughts.

However, it is worth touching on the four guiding principles that are at the heart of this book. ""Humility--the belief that we don't know everything and that we can always be better at the things that matter most. Curiosity--our innate gift for being open to new ideas, new people, and new possibilities. Respect--the belief that everyone matters and that we learn and grow by engaging other people on their own terms. Purpose--our reason for being that guides our efforts to learn and grow.""

Although most of  Gregerman's examples and prescriptions deal with the workplace, they are readily applicable to life beyond the office, and even to one's own reflective practice. Indeed, one of the overarching principles is to seek out differences -- different outlooks, different areas of expertise, and even different lands -- and almost immediately to build human bridges of commonality. Particularly dear to my heart is his repeated statement that travel enriches the traveler and brings the world closer. In that vein, if you'd like, please do feel free to treat this review as the start of a conversation.",Friends we have yet to meet,0,0,130,72,46,27,66,21,1,2,0,1,0,0,526,6
3,0,False,"01 11, 2014",1118461304,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},"The stated premise of the book, that strangers can improve your insight, innovation, and success, is true and is a relevant topic.  Gregerman presents a genial book that I wanted to like. OK, I did like it, but was still left disappointed because it didn't really deliver what it promised.  This isn't really a book about strangers, or being open to the influence of strangers, it's about openmindedness in general.  That's a fine topic too, but one that I have already read and thought extensively about.  That is why I was excited to find a book that would delve deep into one aspect of that -- openmindedness toward strangers.  Alas, this did not deliver.  IF you are looking for a fun and light, but still useful, book on openmindedness, in general, you should be very pleased.  This book offers a shallow look at many dimensions of openmindedness.

Early on, Gregerman writes, ""It may seem counterintuitive that strangers are to be embraced rather than ignored or avoided, but they are a necessity -- precisely because of their differences and what they know that we don't know; their objectivity and ability to be open and honest with us about the things that really matter; and their capacity to challenge us to think very differently about ourselves, the problems we face, and the nature of what is possible.  Finding and engaging the right strangers has the power to make all of us more complete, compelling, innovative, and successful.""  This is exactly what I wanted, but Gregerman doesn't go into details on this.  He basically just tells us to talk with people.  Very general.  Indeed, the first chapter, Necessity, would have made a great article or Kindle Short, as that is where the heart of the idea is.  It's a great chapter in an otherwise average book.

In chapter 4, Innovation, Gregerman tells us to ask ourselves these 8 questions:  What's our best thinking to date?  What's the best thinking in our industry?  What's the best thinking in other industries?  What's the best thinking from popular culture?  What's the best thinking in other cultures?  What's the best insight from nature?  What's the best insight from science?  What are the best possibilities from science fiction?  OK, good questions, and Gregerman gives each a paragraph telling us why it is a good question, but does not give guidance on how to actually answer the questions.

Gregerman really stretches the definition of stranger.  At one point he uses fish as a ""stranger"" and discusses how the schooling behavior of fish led to innovations in accident avoiding cars.  Really, fish as strangers?  Isn't this really about openmindedness in general, and not openmindedness to strangers specifically?  Gregerman explicitly sidesteps the issue of strangers by stating that his approach is ""driven by the reality that in many ways almost all of us are strangers.""  So, are we talking about openness to strangers, or about openness to people in general?  Why did the title of this book not refer to openmindedness rather than strangers?

Some other books also offer insight into what strangers have to offer.  Check out Give And Take, by Adam Grant, which has more to offer than this book does, even though the premise is a bit different.  The Geography of Happiness may also be worth a look, though it is primarily about personal benefit, not business; but of course, these are entwined.  Another book, that Gregerman refers to is Carol Dweck's Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, which is specifically about openmindedness and closemindedness.

Gregerman seems like someone I would love to meet in person and talk with.  Really wish that he had examined the stated topic in more detail so that I could leave a more enthusiastic review.  Gergerman's last paragraph is a good summation of his book, so I present it here.  If this is what you actually want to read about, rather than an in-depth look at strangers, then you should enjoy this book:  ""Use these resources as a starting point for stretching your thinking or as a call to action to look in new places for ideas that could make a real difference to you and your organization.  Then commit to the regular habit of picking up a book or ebook, reading a magazine or blog, or watching a movie or TV show that takes you off of your well-beaten path -- not because everyone else around you is doing so, but because it might take you to a new and remarkable place where the possibility of a breakthrough awaits.""",Fish are strangers?,0,0,146,86,58,50,92,22,2,0,0,0,0,0,757,3

Many job seekers in organizations I joined were on LinkedIn, but they didn't want to link to anyone that they did not know well enough that they would not give them a stellar recommendation. The thinking is, don't link in with anyone who might not have a stellar reputation or they might drag down your reputation. I can see that point, but if I met you at a networking event and you seem reasonably nice and helpful, why not link in with you? Why be so suspicious? If I make it clear to others in my network who might inquire about someone I'm linked with, why not be completely candid and say ""I met them in a networking event and they seemed nice, but I haven't worked with them before so I can't vouch for their work habits or reliability"". How often do you really get asked about someone in your LinkedIn network anyway?

This book served to encourage my more open-minded view of growing my network. I wouldn't link with someone I knew nothing about, but if you've met them and have a positive impression why not offer to help them?

It is important to know what this book defines as a ""stranger"" as you begin to read. Most of us think of strangers as someone we know nothing about. The author broadens this to include people we think we know well but really don't. Or someone we know very casually. I wouldn't categorize these types of people as ""strangers"" but I think it makes a better book title to say ""The Necessity of Strangers"" than ""The Necessity of Acquaintances and Strangers"". The latter title would be more accurate, but I guess it doesn't have the concise sizzle for selling books.

The book is an interesting concept. Opening yourself to insights and possibilities offered by people who have been raised in a different environment/culture is a good idea. Even just listening to viewpoints from others could help you consider avenues you did not consider earlier and help lead to greater success in your personal and business life.

This seems obvious, but it is a significantly different way of thinking about customer service, collaboration, personnel relations, technological change, innovation, and leadership. The book is well-written, well-organized, and peppered with interesting examples, but it mainly argues for a change in attitude, and if you are a bottom-line business type looking for a quick, ready-made prescription to solve your problems, you may be disappointed. There are no charts or graphs or results of studies. Instead the author offers a road map and directions to set you off on your own journey.

5,0,False,"12 29, 2013",1118461304,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},"With talk constantly of ""working your network"" and leveraging your friendships, we lose the importance of expanding our friendships beyond a comfort zone:  to strangers.  Strangers are intimidating, may not want to be engaged, but are valuable to expand your universe and world view.

Once I went to a conference (as a junior person) with some executives from my company.  The executives interacted with each other, and with some people who worked at another location for the same company.  I leveraged my contacts to meet others at the conference, and just downright introduced myself to people.  I was far better at solidifying new business contacts than people who had far more experience than I, only because I was more gregarious and wanted to meet others.

Gregerman expands on this concept very well, and points out the many advantages of dealing with ""new blood"" as opposed to the same old people.

Well written with good examples, ""The Necessity of Strangers"" is an important book for someone looking to expand beyond their sphere and learn from, and teach, others.","""A stranger is just a friend I haven't met yet""",0,0,37,27,14,9,28,3,2,1,0,2,0,0,177,10
3,0,False,"12 27, 2013",1118461304,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},"In  this engaging, readable book, author Gregrerman argues that business and personal growth come when we are open to interacting with strangers. This advice isn't especially new; as the author notes, Granovetter's concept of ""weak ties"" has become familiar. However much I wanted to like this book, I found it hard to identify insights that were truly new and novel and the recommendations, in some cases, impractical.

For instance, on page 26, the author suggests tips to create a plan for success. It's pretty standard: set an objective, develop a plan and so on. One step, ""Find strangers to fill those [knowledge] gaps,"" makes a lot of sense; it's the essential premise of networking. But these days, getting strangers to share information requires fairly sophisticated networking skills.

While the book's premise relates to the importance of strangers, a good part of content is about overcoming resistance to people who might seem to have nothing to teach us. The issue here doesn't seem to be about strangers but about topics related to stereotyping and false appearance. It's important to differentiate true strangers from those we meet in a familiar setting that confers credibility.

Additionally, the people who gain most from dealing with strangers tend to transform the relationship so they're now dealing with friends and personal acquaintances. The stranger factor disappears! For instance, the author describes a meeting with a university administrator who becomes a mentor and advocate. Although the two were strangers initially, they met in a fairly structured situation that was conducive to creating a relationship, and at some early point they stopped being strangers

Perhaps our real challenge is not about breaking down barriers with strangers, but deciding which strangers to approach and how to assess their input. Career changers are urged to seek help from experts in their industry, yet often the ""advice"" they get is inappropriate; however, these people can be valuable as informational resources when approached with carefully designed questions.

In the end, the stranger question becomes both simple and complex. Yes, we will grow by interacting with diverse people who are outside our inner circles. However, sometimes resistance to strangers can help us avoid traps, especially when we're paying or placing ourselves in a vulnerable position.

For instance, the author says he met his wife by connecting with strangers in a particularly clever way - offering a big reward to friends who'd set up an introduction. Sure, these women were strangers, but they were already connected through his own friends, creating an effective filter.

The toolkit at the book's end includes some useful but not entirely novel ideas. In my experience the best way to meet new people in a meaningful is to engage in some new activity. His idea to ""get out of the office"" is a good start, but what about joining a new gym or a new club, trying new networking events, or even taking a class that brings you in contact with people you wouldn't meet otherwise?

Overall the book entertains.  You might have some interesting conversations and talking points when you share the examples But the title leads us to expect something that radically shifts our mindset ... sort of like what happens when we connect with strangers.","Good topic, very entertaining, not truly new and novel",0,0,128,83,47,30,59,2,1,0,4,2,0,0,539,9

The books spends a lot of time demonstrating that this aversion is something that is part of the human make-up, and then shows how this aversion hinders our innovation, creativity, collaboration,  and ability to lead.  I read two or three business books per month, and none of them have yet addressed this interesting point of view in quite this way.

When we do this, we expand our horizons, get out of our limited point of view, and can innovate and lead better.

Being in the 'back' now, I'm not as exposed to clients, internal or external, so this book is actually very timely for me.

Gregerman organizes the book into 3 parts. The first is Framework that explains why we need 'strangers' and the second part is 'Practice' in how it can work and it makes up the bulk of the book.

3,0,True,"01 15, 2017",B00004YWK2,0,"This item does what it's intended for, and does it moderately well. It allows you to redirect the heat from your dryer into your home instead of the outside in the cold months. Unfortunately, there is a significant design flaw, which makes little sense to me. I'll get into that at the end.

First, it's cheap. It's molded plastic that is folded in half to make a tube shape and fit the flapper inside the box. Unfortunately, mine doesn't fold completely and the natural stress in the plastic makes it slightly not circular. This isn't a problem for connecting tubing, but it is a problem for the flapper, as it doesn't seat fully in the outside-flowing tube, so it allows cold air in. Second on the cheap scale are the zip ties it comes with. They are a step up from your standard single-use zip ties, as they have a lever to unlatch and expand them. However, the lever is impossible to push without taking the whole thing off and getting a pair of pliers on both sides of the zip, so it's pointless. Use a standard metal worm clamp instead.

The lint trap is useless: Take a stocking or cut off pantyhose and fit it over the end instead of the lint filter, like you probably do on your washer outlet. It's a much better filter.

Now to the biggest design flaw, which I can only partially try to explain: There is a hole in the flapper, with a small flimsy inner flapper covering it. The effect is that when the flapper is up, to redirect hot air into your home, much of it is still pushed outside. And when it is in the other position, moving air will pull it open and suck out inside air, and/or push hot air into your home (I'm not sure which, as it's winter now and I don't want to test it right now). My only guess why this inner flapper exists at all is that it is to make up for the poorly closing main flapper, so you don't get stagnant moist air hanging out in the section between the ""heat keeper"" and your outside vent. The effect it has is that the heat keeper doesn't rully redirect air, is leaky, and forces you to mount it in one specific orientation, otherwise the inner flapper will hang open and let in outside air.

TLDR: It works, but leaks and could be better, and unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a better option made anymore.","Functional, cheap (good and bad), seems to be only option available unfortunately",0,0,82,57,37,36,43,2,1,1,5,2,0,0,423,12

4,1,True,"12 24, 2016",B00004YWK2,0,"I considered this a starting point. I assumed it would be flimsy based on other reviews but I ordered it anyway. When I got the item, I immediately reinforced it with duct tape, sealing  any potential leaks and reinforcing the ring part.

I used hard ducting cut to size. The one end fit smoothly into the ducting, and I sealed it well with duct tape. For the other side I had an extra pipe joiner that was almost the perfect size. You can get these at Home Depot for about $6. It includes a rubber grommet that has a butt seal inside, a metal band and 2 integrated hose clamps. The two ends met seamlessly and there are zero air leaks.

The unit works great. And we have even run the dryer empty for supplemental heat.

Only complaint is the lint catch system could be a little better, but if it was too fine it would probably blocked much of the air flow, as we use a dryer sheet inside the air filter as well. We prefer to just clean a little lint off the floor from time to time for the enhanced heating.

Same old cheap crap in a different form. I have no idea why these manufacturers cannot add gaskets or silicone rings to these things! I'd be willing to pay 10 dollars more if there was a gasket on the outside of the inlet and outlet, around the closer (door) and on the inside of the little lid. These things leak air like crazy. I use thin foil heat tape and wrap every possible area that might leak. The zip ties do nothing, there is nowhere for them to grip to. There is no lip to keep it from sliding off. Taped that too. The door that swings with the adjuster leaks air too. It's fine in the winter. Horrible in the summer. I also had to tape over the screen and around the lid to seal it. I'll just remove the tape for winter.

I spent 40 minutes taping and testing. It's on and working like it should but one should not have to put so much time and effort into such a simple contraption.
